# timetable-app

## TODO
- Check pickSlot function works when time matches ✔
- Calculate time from startTime to finishTime ✔
- Finish pickSlot functionality - should find the closest activity that is about to start then start timer (timetable app) when it reaches the startTime ✔
- When the time ends for an activity, an incredibly annoying alarm should ring ✔
- When an activity is in session, make the background go blue or whatever RNG colour ✔
- Screen should only display info about activity, start time, end time and maybe the next activity ✔
- If you click on the screen anywhere the timetable finishes ✔
- You can click the submit button again and it will start up like you never left ✔

- Fill in lesson - add label to HTML so we can add lessons
